- Git Cheats : 

- to get the updated copy of code from github:
  - git pull

- to submit updates to github
  - git add -u
  - git status (make sure the files you want to add were added, if they weren't you can specify them saying "git add [file path]"
  - git commit -m "MESSAGE ABOUT COMMIT"
  - git push


- General:
  - to see what's up with git and where you are: git status
  - if you changed something you don't want to save you can do: git stash 
(but only do this if you don't want to save ANYTHING you haven't commited yet)
  - Rule of thumb: commit often! Push up your code when you have major changes.
